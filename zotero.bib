The calculation of the annual growth rate of GDP volume is intended to allow comparisons of the dynamics of economic development both over time and between economies of different sizes. For measuring the growth rate of GDP in terms of volumes, the GDP at current prices are valued in the prices of the previous year and the thus computed volume changes are imposed on the level of a reference year; this is called a chain-linked series. Accordingly, price movements will not inflate the growth rate.},

In contrast with the previous literature which assumes coordination, this paper analyzes the case where coordination lacks among ﬁscal authorities as well as between ﬁscal and monetary authorities. I show that the normative prescriptions emphasized by former analyses are not valid any more once policymakers are not coordinated. Indeed, in that case the common central bank does not stabilize the average union inﬂation as if it were in a closed economy because it has to take into account the distortions caused by the lack of coordination among ﬁscal policymakers. At the same time, if there is not a common agreement to coordinate ﬁscal policies, autonomous governments should use government expenditure as a stabilization tool even if shocks are symmetric.},

Output gap uncertainty reduces the response to the current estimated output gap relative to current inflation and may partly explain why the parameters in estimated Taylor rules are often much lower than suggested by optimal control exercises which assume the state of the economy is known.},

These studies mostly focus on individual countries, while cross-country evidence is scarce. In this paper, we use a set of (panel) BVAR models to study the effect of uncertainty shocks on economic developments in EU Member States. We derive new proxies of domestic uncertainty for individual Member States using dispersion of answers in the Business and Consumer Surveys administered by the European Commission. We also explicitly distinguish between idiosyncratic and common uncertainty shocks. In addition, we assess the impact of structural characteristics in sub-samples of EU countries to understand their role in shock transmission. The results suggest that real output in EU countries drops after spikes in uncertainty, mainly as a result of lower investment. Unlike for the U.S., there is little evidence of activity overshooting following this initial fall. The responses to uncertainty shocks vary across Member States. These differences can be attributed not only to different shock sizes, but also to cross-country structural characteristics. Member States with more ﬂexible labour markets and product markets seem to weather uncertainty shocks better. Likewise, a higher manufacturing share and higher economic diversiﬁcation help dampen the impact of uncertainty shocks. The role of economic openness is more ambiguous.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the nature of macroeconomic spillovers from advanced economies to emerging market economies (EMEs) and the consequences for independent use of monetary policy in EMEs. We first empirically document the effects of US monetary policy shocks on a sample group of EMEs. A contractionary monetary shock leads a retrenchment in EME capital flows, a fall in EME GDP, and an exchange rate depreciation. We construct a the- oretical model which can help to account for these findings. In the model, macroeconomic spillovers are exacerbated by financial frictions. We assess the extent to which domestic monetary policy can mitigate the negative spillovers from foreign shocks. Absent financial frictions, international spillovers are minor, and an inflation targeting rule represents an ef- fective policy for the EME. With frictions in financial intermediation, however, spillovers are substantially magnified, and an inflation targeting rule has little advantage over an exchange rate peg. However, an optimal monetary policy markedly improves on the performance of naive inflation targeting or an exchange rate peg. Furthermore, optimal policies don’t need to be coordinated across countries. Under the specific set of assumptions maintained in our model, a non-cooperative, self-oriented optimal policy gives results very similar to those of a global cooperative optimal policy.},

These weights coincide with the economic sizes of the region. If the degrees of rigidity are different, the optimal plan implies a high degree of inertia in the inflation rate.

Diferente da maior parte da literatura, a pequena economia aberta é derivada como um caso-limite do modelo para dois países, em vez de supor que as variáveis externas seguem processos exógenos. Este procedimento preserva o papel desempenhado pelas fricções nominais do resto do mundo na transmissão dos choques externos sobre a economia pequena. Usando uma abordagem bayesiana, o caso-limite do modelo para uma pequena economia é estimado com dados brasileiros e funções impulso-resposta são construídas para análise dos efeitos dinâmicos dos choques estruturais.},

	abstract = {We develop a model of staggered prices along the lines of Phelps (1978) and Taylor (1979, 1980), but utilizing an analytically more tractable price-setting technology. ‘Demands’ are derived from utility maximization assuming Sidrauski-Brock infinitely-lived families. We show that the nature of the equilibrium path can be found out on the basis of essentially graphical techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model by analyzing the welfare implications of monetary and fiscal policy, and by showing that despite the price level being a predetermined variable, a policy of pegging the nominal interest rate will lead to the existence of a continuum of equilibria.},

Yet Danmarks Nationalbank has been able to maintain the krone’s peg to the euro since the euro came into existence in 1999, and the krone’s peg to the Deutschmark and SDR for 17 years before that. This paper considers a series of hypotheses that may help to account for the exceptional nature of this case. None of these explanations is entirely satisfactory, but collectively they go some way toward explaining the Danish exception.},

	abstract = {This paper presents new evidence on the patterns of price and wage adjustment in European ﬁrms and on the extent of nominal rigidities. It uses a unique dataset collected through a ﬁrm-level survey conducted in 17 European countries and covering various sectors. Several conclusions are drawn from this evidence. Firms adjust wages less frequently than prices, on average every 15 and 10 months, respectively. Price and, especially, wage adjustment exhibit a substantial degree of time-dependence. In particular, wage changes tend to cluster at a speciﬁc time of the year, mostly January in the majority of countries. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that prices are more ﬂexible when competitive pressures in product markets are strong and when labor costs account for a lower fraction of ﬁrms' total costs, whereas wages are more ﬂexible when bargaining is decentralized and when the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Price rigidities are higher in ﬁrms with a larger share of high-skilled/white-collar workers.},

I show that in a standard DSGE model RWR is mainly affected by the interaction of the two nominal rigidities and not by other structural parameters. The degree of RWR is, however, considerably inﬂuenced by the modelling assumption about the structure of wage contracts (Calvo vs. Taylor) and about other institutional characteristics of wage-setting (clustering of contracts, heterogeneous contract length, indexation). I use survey evidence on price- and wage-setting for 15 European countries to calculate the degrees of RWR implied by the theoretical model. The average level of RWR is broadly in line with empirical estimates based on macroeconomic data. In order to be able to also match the observed cross-country variation in RWR it is, however, essential to move beyond the country-speciﬁc durations of price and wages and to take more institutional details into account.},

To this purpose, this study relies on a two-country Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model, where the two countries are supposed to be differently sensitive to the bank capital channel. The model allows us to demonstrate how a given symmetric shock causes cyclical divergences inside a heterogeneous monetary union. On this point, it allows reproducing some stylized facts recently observed in the Euro Area. Moreover, it appears that the more heterogeneous the union, the larger the effects of ﬁnancial asymmetries on the transmission of shocks. Finally, we show that a common monetary policy contributes to worsen cyclical divergences, in comparison with monetary policies that would be nationally conducted.},
